### The Death Location (Specific)
Fourth floor, northeast corner. The area was formerly a large dormitory, now demolished to bare structure. Temporary support beams hold up portions of the roof. Debris from demolished walls is piled along the edges. The floor is a patchwork of original timber (weakened by water damage), concrete (cracked), and temporary plywood (rotten). Approximately 15 meters from the rooftop access stairwell.

- Night: Near silence in the abandoned floors, creaking of old building, wind through plastic sheeting, occasional party sounds from Old Town bars

### Smells

- Street: Tobacco (city's heritage), coffee from sidewalk cafes, autumn leaves decomposing
- Specific to death location: Wet concrete, mold, rust, old timber rot

### Textures
- Surfaces: Rough exposed brick, crumbling plaster, gritty dust coating everything, cold metal scaffolding

### Visual Details

## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Dimitar "Mitko" Kolev
**Description:** 58, former factory worker, hired because he was cheap. Chain-smokes. Speaks minimal English. Haunted expression. Knows the building is dangerous but needs the job.
**Role in death:** Warning-giver (ignored). Explicitly told Priya the upper floors are "death" in broken English. Will feel guilty forever.

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Baba Yordanka | 70-year-old grandmother, cleans twice weekly, crosses herself when passing construction zone |
| Security | None | There is no security |
| Bar/Kitchen | N/A | No bar, communal kitchen only |
| Manager | Stefan Richter | German investor, rarely present, prioritizes cost-cutting, answers phone from Berlin |

### Staff Knowledge
Mitko knows exactly how dangerous the building is. He's watched the construction stall, seen the temporary beams go unbraced, noticed the water damage. He's reported it to Stefan, who said "just keep guests off those floors." Mitko puts up barriers. He does not check if guests obey them.

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Apologetic and dusty. Guests pick their way around construction materials in the courtyard. The common room TV plays Bulgarian news no one understands. It feels like staying in a building that's dying.

### Night Vibe
Creepy. The few guests cluster in the common room. Strange sounds from upper floors—settling? Construction debris shifting? The plastic sheeting rustles constantly. No one sleeps well.

### Guest Demographics
Ultra-budget travelers, mostly solo. People who booked without reading recent reviews. A few construction workers from the crew also stay here (irony). Average stay: 1-2 nights before leaving for better options.

### Reputation
Recent reviews (buried beneath old positive ones): "Don't stay here, it's a construction site!" / "I thought I would die in this place" / "Only for the truly desperate." Older reviews praise the rooftop view that no longer exists.

## Practical Details

### Getting There
30-minute walk from Plovdiv Central Station, or 8-lev taxi. In the Kapana arts district, but on a back street away from the galleries and cafes. You have to want to find it.

### Check-in Process
Mitko slowly photocopies passport. Mumbles about avoiding upper floors. Hands over sheets that smell of dust. Points vaguely at plastic barriers. Does not give tour.

### Rules
1. Quiet after 23:00
2. No smoking inside (ignored)
3. Kitchen closes at 22:00
4. DO NOT ENTER CONSTRUCTION ZONES (multiple signs, multiple languages)
5. Hostel not responsible for injuries

### Amenities
- [x] Wi-Fi (quality: terrible, router in construction zone)
- [x] Kitchen (functional)
- [x] Lockers (not enough for all guests)
- [ ] Laundry
- [ ] Pool
- [ ] Bar
- [ ] Rooftop (closed)
- [ ] Tours offered
- [x] Other: "Character" (dust, danger, regret)

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Plovdiv's Old Town is accurately described; the Roman amphitheater and Revival architecture are real
- Kapana district's artsy reputation is real
- Bulgarian hospitality culture is genuinely important
- Construction safety standards in Bulgaria have improved but budget projects sometimes cut corners

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Avoid stereotyping Bulgaria as "dangerous Eastern Europe"
- The danger is specific negligence, not national character
- Show Mitko as sympathetic—a product of economic circumstances, not villainy
- Bulgarian readers should recognize the setting, not feel mocked

### Sources
- Plovdiv tourist information
- EU construction safety regulations (and their inconsistent enforcement)
- Hostelworld and Booking.com reviews for Plovdiv hostels
- News reports on construction site accidents in Southeastern Europe
