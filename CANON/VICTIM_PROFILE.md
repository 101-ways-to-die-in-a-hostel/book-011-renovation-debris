# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Priya Venkatesh
**Nickname/Handle:** @PennywisePriya
**Age:** 26
**Nationality:** British-Indian
**Occupation:** Former junior accountant, now "professional budget traveler"

## Archetype
**Primary:** Budget Traveler

**Secondary traits:** Frugality obsessive, secret-spot hunter, spreadsheet devotee

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Greed (specifically, the greed for savings over safety)

**How it manifests:**
- Refuses to pay for anything at listed price, always seeking discounts
- Chooses accommodations based purely on cost, ignoring safety reviews
- Sees barriers and "No Entry" signs as challenges rather than warnings
- Justifies dangerous choices as "smart travel hacks"

**How it kills them:**
Her obsession with accessing the hostel's "secret" rooftop view (mentioned in a 2-year-old blog post before renovations) leads her past construction barriers where unstable scaffolding and debris await.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 5'4", slim but strong from carrying a heavy backpack everywhere
- **Hair:** Long black hair, always in a practical braid
- **Distinguishing features:** Weathered hiking sandals, multiple friendship bracelets, permanent squint from calculating costs
- **Typical outfit:** Well-worn quick-dry clothing, cargo pants with secret pockets for cash, neck wallet visible under shirt

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Resourceful - becomes reckless corner-cutting
2. Determined - becomes stubborn disregard for warnings

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Competitive frugality - must pay less than anyone else, leads to dangerous hostel choice
2. Secret-keeper - hoards "insider tips" and won't share, so no one knows where she went

### Pet Peeves
- People who pay full price for things (ironic: she'll pay with her life)
- "Touristy" spots with safety regulations
- Travelers who "waste money" on proper accommodations

### Fears
- Surface fear: Running out of money before trip ends
- Deeper fear: Being ordinary, having nothing to show for her travels

## Background

### Origin Story
Priya grew up in Leicester in a middle-class family that never quite felt financially secure. Her parents' constant worry about money became her inheritance. She worked as a junior accountant for three years, saving every penny, calculating exactly how long she could travel on her savings. She quit the day she hit her target number, determined to prove she could see the world on less than anyone.

### Why They Travel
To prove that money isn't necessary for extraordinary experiences. Every Instagram post is a thesis statement: "You don't need to be rich to travel." But underneath, she's running from the fear that she'll return to her beige cubicle with nothing but spreadsheets and regret.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Found it in an old forum post: "Crazy cheap hostel in Plovdiv, ignore the construction, the views are worth it." The hostel was advertising 70% off because of ongoing renovations. Other travelers avoided it. Priya saw opportunity.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "budget hack," "insider tip," "local secret," "overpriced," "tourist trap"
- Avoids words like: "expensive" (prefers "overpriced"), "dangerous" (prefers "adventurous")
- Catchphrases: "I got a deal you wouldn't believe," "That's the tourist price"

### Speech Pattern
- Quick, clipped sentences loaded with numbers and prices
- Always comparing costs, "For that price, I could stay three nights in..."
- Slight Leicester accent with adopted traveler slang

### Internal Monologue Style
Constant calculations. Every experience filtered through cost-benefit analysis. Anxiety-adjacent vigilance about spending.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram with linked budget travel blog
- **Follower count:** 23,400
- **Posting style:** Price breakdowns, "how I spent only X in Y country," secret spot reveals
- **Last post before death:** "Found the cheapest hostel in Bulgaria. Yes, there's construction. No, I don't care. The rooftop is worth it. Story tomorrow."

### Online vs Reality
Online: Confident budget travel guru living her best life
Reality: Exhausted from constantly seeking deals, lonely from competitiveness, secretly terrified her savings are running out

## Relationships

### Family
- Parents worried sick about her travels, she dismisses their concerns as "immigrant anxiety"
- Younger brother envies her freedom, doesn't see the desperation

### Friends
- Had travel friends but alienated them with her extreme frugality and competitiveness
- Currently traveling alone, prefers it (no one to split costs with means no one to judge her choices)

### Romantic
- Dating apps show her location, matches rarely meet in person due to her budget restrictions
- Brief hostel romances that end when she moves to the next cheap destination

### At the Hostel
- Annoyed by construction workers who block "her" rooftop access
- Dismissive of other guests who "overpay" for completed wings
- Briefly connects with another budget traveler, shares nothing about her rooftop plan

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Wakes at 5 AM to maximize hostel's free breakfast. Calculates remaining budget. Scouts the construction barriers, finds a gap in the plastic sheeting. Messages no one.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Standing at the base of the construction stairwell, phone flashlight on, thinking about the Instagram story she'll post: the forbidden view, the ultimate budget hack.

### Final Thoughts
"The floor shouldn't be moving. This isn't—the spreadsheet didn't account for—"

### Last Words
"Wait—no—" (cut off by collapsing debris)
